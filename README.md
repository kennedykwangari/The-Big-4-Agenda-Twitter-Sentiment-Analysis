### The Data Science Challenge

The task was to collect data form social media and use it to gauge Kenyan's attitude and sentiments towards the President's Big Four Agenda in general and the individual  pillars in particular.
  
  We were tasked to find out their sentiments towards the initiative and whether there are areas they are more or less positive about and the  most supported and least supported pillar.
